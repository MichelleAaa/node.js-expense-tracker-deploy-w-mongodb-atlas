Note that the Transaction detail section at the top will update the total for the Income column as well as the balance. Because the balance is positive, the total dollar amount value has turned green. Also, please note that each transaction can be either updated (with the green pencil icon) or deleted (with the red trashcan icon).")

After adding an income transaction, it will populate in the Income column of the Transaction History. Note that the Transaction detail section at the top will update the total for the Income column as well as the balance. Because the balance is positive, the total dollar amount value has turned green. Also, please note that each transaction can be either updated (with the green pencil icon) or deleted (with the red trashcan icon).



Zero Totals Will Reflect a Darker Color

![Zero Totals Will Reflect a Darker Color](client/src/assets/readme-img/expense-tracker-expense.jpeg "If the income and expense transactions even out to zero, the Balance field will reflect a darker color.")

If the income and expense transactions even out to zero, the Balance (aka total) field will reflect a darker color.

## Launch Note

Please note that this version of the project is for deployment only. Another version of the project is available that runs off of a local installation of mongoDB instead of requiring a mongoDB Atlas account, which is required to run this version.

## Reflection

I built this project after studying in the course focused on Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose in NuCamp's Full Stack Web and Mobile Application Development Bootcamp. One of the challenges of this project included learning how to connect the backend to the frontend.
